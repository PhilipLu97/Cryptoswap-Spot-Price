# Cryptoswap-Spot-Price
We differentiate Curve v2's Cryptoswap invariant to derive a spot price formula and compare it to the "get_p" function currently implemented in [Tricrypto-NG pools](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-tricrypto-0/deposit). We output Cryptoswap parameters and test results in a csv file, and we plot a histogram of differences between the errors of the two spot price formulas relative to an effective swap price.
